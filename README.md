# How to start BE and FE

For BE: npm start.

For FE: npm start.

You should start BE before start FE.

## What I did

Supported the load more features with nodejs server and mongodb by cursor based approach.

Filtered API by authors and titles.

Could be able to refresh after 60s.

## What can be improved if I have more time

Add unit tests, integration tests, api tests for BE and FE.

Add storybook for demonstrating UI library.

Split library components (Mantine) to a separated folder to easily mantainence.

Build ci/cd for projects.

## Time estimation for FE & BE

About 3 days.
